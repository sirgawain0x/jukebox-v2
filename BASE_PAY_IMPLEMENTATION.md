# Base Pay Integration - AI Image Generation

## Overview

Successfully migrated AI image generation payment from OnchainKit Transaction components to Base Pay SDK. This simplifies the payment flow and provides automatic onramp support for users without USDC balance.

## What Changed

### ✅ Frontend Changes (`app/components/music/PlaylistSection.tsx`)

1. **Added Base Pay SDK Import**
   ```typescript
   import { pay, getPaymentStatus } from "@base-org/account";
   ```

2. **Simplified Payment Flow**
   - Removed manual USDC transaction construction
   - Removed payment modal UI (Base Pay handles this)
   - Removed USDC balance checks (Base Pay handles this automatically)
   - Added payment status polling with 30-second timeout

3. **New `handleGenerateImage` Function**
   - Uses `pay()` function with simple parameters:
     - `amount: '0.25'` - $0.25 USDC
     - `to: PAYMENT_RECIPIENT` - Your wallet address
     - `testnet: false` - Use Base mainnet
   - Polls payment status using `getPaymentStatus()`
   - Calls API with `paymentId` instead of `paymentTxHash`

4. **Removed Code**
   - `showPaymentModal` state variable
   - `usdcBalance` check and state
   - `usdcPaymentCalls` function
   - `handlePaymentSuccess` function
   - `handlePaymentError` function
   - Payment modal UI component
   - OnchainKit Transaction component for payments (still used for playlist deployment)

### ✅ Backend Changes (`app/api/gemini/text-to-image/route.ts`)

1. **Replaced Transaction Verification**
   - **Before:** Used `viem` to verify on-chain transaction with `paymentTxHash`
   - **After:** Uses Base Pay's `getPaymentStatus()` with `paymentId`

2. **Simplified Payment Verification**
   ```typescript
   const paymentStatus = await getPaymentStatus({
     id: paymentId,
     testnet: false
   });

   if (paymentStatus.status !== 'completed') {
     return 402 error
   }
   ```

3. **Added Recipient Verification**
   - Optionally checks that payment recipient matches expected wallet address
   - Uses `paymentStatus.recipient` field

### ✅ Configuration Changes (`next.config.ts`)

1. **Removed Old x402 Headers**
   - Deleted `async headers()` section with x402 CORS headers
   - These were only needed for the old x402 payment protocol
   - Cleaned up unnecessary configuration

### ✅ Dependencies

**Added:**
- `@base-org/account@2.4.0` - Base Pay SDK

**Removed:**
- No packages removed (can optionally remove viem if not used elsewhere)

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

1. User enters image prompt
2. User clicks "Generate with Gemini AI" button
3. System checks wallet connection
4. Base Pay payment UI appears (handled by SDK)
5. User completes payment through Base Pay
   - Automatic onramp if insufficient USDC
   - Seamless wallet experience
6. Frontend polls payment status every second (max 30 seconds)
7. Once payment is `completed`, frontend calls API
8. Backend verifies payment with Base Pay
9. Backend generates image with Gemini
10. User sees generated image

### Technical Flow

```
Client                                    Base Pay                Server
------                                    --------                ------
handleGenerateImage()
  ↓
pay({
  amount: '0.05',
  to: recipient,
  testnet: false
}) ─────────────────────────────────────→ Base Pay UI shows
  ↓                                          User completes payment
payment = { id: "..." }                   ←─ Payment processing
  ↓
Poll getPaymentStatus({ id, testnet })
  ↓
status.status === 'completed'
  ↓
POST /api/gemini/text-to-image
  { prompt, paymentId } ──────────────────────────────────────→ getPaymentStatus()
                                                                  ↓
                                                                  Verify completed
                                                                  ↓
                                                                  Generate image
  ←─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── { success, imageUrl }
  ↓
Display image to user
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```env
# Your wallet address to receive payments
WALLET_ADDRESS=0x1Fde40a4046Eda0cA0539Dd6c77ABF8933B94260

# Or use NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_ADDRESS (same value)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x1Fde40a4046Eda0cA0539Dd6c77ABF8933B94260

# Gemini API key for image generation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Payment Configuration

- **Cost:** $0.25 USDC per image generation
- **Network:** Base Mainnet
- **Token:** USDC (handled automatically by Base Pay)
- **Payment Provider:** Base Pay SDK
- **Image Generation:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano banana)

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. Wallet with Coinbase Smart Wallet or compatible wallet
2. Access to Base Pay (automatic onramp available)
3. Internet connection

### Test Steps
1. Navigate to playlist creation
2. Enter a cover image prompt
3. Click "Generate with Gemini AI"
4. Complete payment through Base Pay UI
   - If you have USDC: Direct payment
   - If no USDC: Onramp flow will appear
5. Wait for payment confirmation (up to 30 seconds)
6. Image should generate and display

### What to Check
- ✅ Base Pay UI appears correctly
- ✅ Payment completes successfully
- ✅ Status updates show in UI
- ✅ API verifies payment
- ✅ Image generates correctly
- ✅ No console errors

## Troubleshooting

### "Please connect your wallet first"
- User wallet not connected
- Connect wallet before generating image

### "Payment timeout - please try again"
- Payment took longer than 30 seconds
- Check Base Pay transaction status
- Try again with a fresh payment

### "Payment verification failed"
- Payment may not have completed
- Check payment status in Base Pay
- Ensure payment went to correct recipient

### "Failed to generate image"
- GEMINI_API_KEY may be invalid
- Check server logs for Gemini API errors
- Verify API key is set correctly

## Payment Status Types

Base Pay returns the following status types:

- `pending` - Payment initiated but not yet complete
- `completed` - Payment successfully completed
- `failed` - Payment failed (includes `reason` field)
- `not_found` - Payment ID not found

## API Reference

### Frontend: Base Pay Functions

```typescript
// Initiate payment
const payment = await pay({
  amount: '0.25',    // Amount in USDC
  to: walletAddress, // Recipient address
  testnet: false     // Use mainnet
});
// Returns: { id: string }

// Check payment status
const status = await getPaymentStatus({
  id: paymentId,     // Payment ID from pay()
  testnet: false     // Use mainnet
});
// Returns: PaymentStatus object
```

### Backend: Payment Verification

```typescript
import { getPaymentStatus } from "@base-org/account";

const paymentStatus = await getPaymentStatus({
  id: paymentId,
  testnet: false
});

// Check status
if (paymentStatus.status === 'completed') {
  // Payment verified
  // paymentStatus.recipient - who received payment
  // paymentStatus.amount - amount sent
  // paymentStatus.sender - who sent payment
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Payment Caching**
   - Store verified payments in database
   - Prevent payment reuse
   - Track payment history

2. **Multiple Payment Options**
   - Accept ETH in addition to USDC
   - Support other ERC-20 tokens

3. **Pricing Tiers**
   - Different costs for different image qualities
   - Bulk discounts for multiple generations

4. **Payment Analytics**
   - Track total revenue
   - Monitor conversion rates
   - Analyze payment success rates

5. **Extended Base Pay Features**
   - Use for artist tipping as alternative
   - Use for playlist deployment
   - Unified payment experience

## Optional Cleanup

### Can Be Removed (Optional)

If not used elsewhere in the project, you can remove:

```bash
npm uninstall viem
```
