# OnchainKit USDC Payment Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully replaced the complex x402 payment protocol with a simpler, more reliable OnchainKit-based USDC payment system for AI image generation.

## What Changed

### ✅ Frontend Changes (`app/components/music/PlaylistSection.tsx`)

1. **Added Payment Modal State**
   - New `showPaymentModal` state for controlling payment UI

2. **Simplified `handleGenerateImage` Function**
   - Removed all x402 signature logic
   - Now simply shows payment modal after validation checks
   - Checks for Base mainnet (chainId 8453)
   - Checks for sufficient USDC balance (0.05 USDC)

3. **Added USDC Payment Functions**
   - `usdcPaymentCalls`: Creates simple USDC transfer transaction
   - `handlePaymentSuccess`: Calls API after payment completes
   - `handlePaymentError`: Handles payment failures

4. **Added Payment Modal UI**
   - Clean modal with Transaction/TransactionButton components
   - Shows payment amount ($0.05 USDC) and prompt
   - Uses OnchainKit's Transaction component for wallet interaction

### ✅ Backend Changes (`app/api/gemini/text-to-image/route.ts`)

1. **Removed x402 Dependencies**
   - No longer uses `withPayment` wrapper
   - No longer uses x402 middleware

2. **Added Direct Payment Verification**
   - Accepts `paymentTxHash` in request body
   - Uses `viem` to verify transaction on Base mainnet
   - Checks if transaction succeeded
   - Returns 402 if payment is missing or invalid

3. **Simplified Flow**
   - Payment verification → Image generation → Response
   - Clear error messages for payment issues

### ✅ Removed Files

- `lib/payment-handler.ts` → Moved to `lib/payment-handler.ts.old` (backup)

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

1. User enters image prompt
2. User clicks "Generate with AI" button
3. System checks:
   - Wallet is connected
   - Connected to Base mainnet
   - Has at least 0.05 USDC
4. Payment modal appears
5. User clicks "Pay 0.05 USDC"
6. Coinbase wallet prompts for approval
7. USDC transfer executes on Base
8. Frontend receives transaction hash
9. Frontend calls API with prompt + tx hash
10. Backend verifies payment on-chain
11. Backend generates image with Gemini
12. User sees generated image

### Technical Flow

```
Client                          Server
------                          ------
handleGenerateImage()
  ↓
showPaymentModal = true
  ↓
User approves in wallet
  ↓
usdcPaymentCalls() executes
  ↓
handlePaymentSuccess(txReceipt)
  ↓
POST /api/gemini/text-to-image    
  { prompt, paymentTxHash } ----→ Verify tx on Base mainnet
                                   ↓
                                   Generate image with Gemini
                                   ↓
  ←------------------------------ { success: true, imageUrl }
  ↓
Display image to user
```

## Key Advantages Over x402

1. **✅ Works with Coinbase Smart Wallet**
   - No WebAuthn signature incompatibility issues
   - Uses standard ECDSA signatures Coinbase wallets support

2. **✅ Simpler Implementation**
   - ~500 lines of complex x402 code → ~100 lines of clean code
   - No facilitators, no ERC-3009, no EIP-712 typed data

3. **✅ More Reliable**
   - Standard ERC-20 transfer everyone knows
   - No dependency on external x402 facilitator service
   - Direct on-chain verification

4. **✅ Better UX**
   - Familiar Coinbase wallet payment flow
   - Clear transaction prompts
   - Standard Base network transaction

5. **✅ Easier to Debug**
   - Standard blockchain transactions
   - Can verify payments on BaseScan
   - Clear error messages

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```env
# Your wallet address to receive payments
WALLET_ADDRESS=0x1Fde40a4046Eda0cA0539Dd6c77ABF8933B94260

# Or use NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_ADDRESS (same value)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x1Fde40a4046Eda0cA0539Dd6c77ABF8933B94260

# Gemini API key for image generation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Payment Configuration

- **Cost**: $0.05 USDC per image generation
- **Network**: Base Mainnet (chainId: 8453)
- **Token**: USDC (`0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`)
- **Amount**: 50,000 (0.05 * 10^6, USDC has 6 decimals)

## Optional Cleanup

### Can Be Removed (Optional)

The following x402 dependencies are no longer needed and can be removed:

```bash
npm uninstall @coinbase/x402 x402-fetch x402-next
```

Then remove from `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@coinbase/x402": "^0.7.0",      // Remove
    "x402-fetch": "^0.7.0",          // Remove
    "x402-next": "^0.7.0"            // Remove
  }
}
```

### Files That Can Be Deleted (Backed Up)

- `lib/payment-handler.ts.old` (backup of old x402 handler)
- `NEW_PAYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.tsx` (implementation reference)
- Old documentation files (if not needed):
  - `MANUAL_PAYMENT_FLOW.md`
  - `MANUAL_ERC3009_PAYMENT.md`
  - `HEADER_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
  - `DEBUG_402_ISSUE.md`
  - `MAINNET_FIX.md`
  - `FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
  - `ENV_VARIABLE_FIX.md`
  - `TESTING_PAYMENT_FIX.md`
  - `CURRENT_STATUS.md`

### Next.js Config Cleanup

The CORS headers in `next.config.ts` for x402 headers can be removed:

```typescript
// These can be removed:
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/api/:path*',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers',
          value: 'WWW-Authenticate, X-402-Version, X-402-Scheme...',  // Remove this
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
},
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. Coinbase Smart Wallet connected
2. Connected to Base Mainnet
3. At least 0.10 USDC in wallet (for payment + gas)

### Test Steps
1. Navigate to playlist creation
2. Enter a cover image prompt
3. Click "Generate with AI"
4. Payment modal should appear
5. Click "Pay 0.05 USDC"
6. Approve in Coinbase wallet
7. Wait for transaction confirmation
8. Image should generate and display

### What to Check
- ✅ Payment modal appears
- ✅ Transaction prompts in wallet
- ✅ Payment completes successfully
- ✅ API verifies payment
- ✅ Image generates correctly
- ✅ No console errors

## Troubleshooting

### "Please switch to Base mainnet"
- User is on wrong network
- Switch to Base Mainnet in wallet

### "Insufficient USDC balance"
- User doesn't have enough USDC
- Need at least 0.05 USDC + gas

### "Payment verification failed"
- Transaction may have failed
- Check transaction on BaseScan
- Ensure wallet has enough gas

### "Failed to generate image"
- GEMINI_API_KEY may be invalid
- Check server logs for Gemini API errors
- Verify API key is set correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Enhanced Payment Verification**
   - Decode transaction logs to verify:
     - Exact USDC token address
     - Exact amount transferred
     - Correct recipient address
   - Prevent payment reuse

2. **Payment Caching**
   - Store verified payments in database
   - Prevent double-spending of same transaction

3. **Multiple Payment Methods**
   - Accept ETH in addition to USDC
   - Support other ERC-20 tokens

4. **Pricing Tiers**
   - Different costs for different image qualities
   - Bulk discounts

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs (both browser and server)
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check transaction on BaseScan
4. Review this documentation
